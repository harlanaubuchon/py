Description
-----------

Minder is a DVCS Semi-automatic-syncing File System and Organization Application designed to simplify the synchronization of files between multiple devices.

Minder wants to ensure only one particular file exists in the system and tracks changes made to that file.  The file system tree is maintained by User and may be synchronized to a central repository if needed.  Certain file types (e.g, Pictures, PDFs) may be configured to be moved to a particular folder location automatically.

Minder sounds like git-annex or other DVCS-Autosync programs but the differences are distinct in two ways:

* Minder is manual â€“ it wants you to choose which files you want on your devices by selecting folders and which you don't want anymore.
* Minder wants to help you stay organized by cleaning up after you, renaming files so they have future context, and putting things in the right place.
